# ImageCompressionEnhancement

# Compression and enhancement of Image Quality

## Problem üåç 
With plethora of images transferring between client and server we sometimes choke the bandwidth. Companies that primarily play with images face repeated problem of ***image movement***, ***cost*** and ***poor quality***. Considering the speed of development I have integrated 'high quality' lossy image compression and image quality enhancement project of mine. 

## Installation instructions 
The project run inside docker container so you do not need to worry about any installation. Just follow simple instructions.

Download the project using
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arindammalik/ImageCompressionEnhancement.git
```
